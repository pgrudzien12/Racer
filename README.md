# Racer
Simple car racing simulation model made in Unity3D.

This project serves as my place to learn Unity3D.

## Running the project
To run the project you must have Unity3D installed. Open the project, select Scene from Scenes folder and press play.

To control the car use WSAD or arrow keys. 

## Models
### Scene 1
This model contains a human controlled car (use WSAD or arrow keys). The phisics model is very simple and involves setting turn and forward/backward force.

I used custom made physics and unity collision detection system.
